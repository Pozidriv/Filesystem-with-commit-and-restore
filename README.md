# OS_Project
A simple shadow filesystem. Should work well. Commit and restore seems to work, but no guarantees on that.
To compile for a baisc test: `make test1`
To compile for a stress test: `make test2`
To compile for an interactive test: `make mytest`


There is one edge case where the filesystem might have undefined behavior:
When doing commit and restore of files large enough to use a block of pointers
